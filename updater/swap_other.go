// Linux has renameat2 with RENAME_EXCHANGE, which would serve, but it is refused by several filesystems in common use
// and needs a runtime fallback anyway. Windows has no equivalent at all. Since what is being replaced on both of these
// platforms is a single file rather than a directory tree, the two-rename form is straightforward and its window --
// the microseconds between moving the old file aside and moving the new one in -- is covered by the startup repair.
