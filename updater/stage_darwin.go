// stageHelper places a copy of the running application in the staging directory and returns the executable to run. See

//
// The whole bundle is copied, not just the executable inside it. A bundle's main executable is signed with the hashes
// of Contents/Info.plist and of the sealed resource directory recorded in its own signature, so that file on its own
// carries a signature that can never be satisfied: macOS rejects it and kills the process at exec, before a line of
// this program runs. Nothing would report that, either -- the helper starts as the application quits, and a process the
// kernel kills writes no log.
//
// For the same reason the copy has to keep the executable's name and its position within the bundle. Only the name of
// the bundle directory itself is free, and it deliberately does not end in ".app", so that Launch Services does not
// index a second com.trollworks.gcs sitting in the staging directory.
//
// ditto rather than a hand-rolled copy, for the reason given in stagePayload: it is what carries the extended
// attributes, access control lists and BSD flags a valid signature depends on. For a target that is a bare executable
// rather than a bundle, this copies just that file, which is the same thing the other platforms do.
